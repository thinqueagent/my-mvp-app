Problem: Instead of making an effort to extract data, AI jumps to asking users to manually input missing values.

2️⃣ Fix: AI Should First Attempt to Extract & Suggest Data
💬 AI: "Here’s what I found in your document. Let’s refine it together."

✅ Brand Mission: "Our vision is to empower every woman in recognizing and appreciating her own individuality, as well as promoting a more body-positive ideal in the swimwear industry."
✅ Brand Values: Confidence, Self-Expression, Inclusivity
✅ Brand Voice: Confident, Empowering, Body-Positive

3️⃣ If AI is Uncertain, It Should Offer Suggestions (Instead of Blank Fields)
💬 AI: "Some details weren’t explicitly labeled. Here’s what I inferred based on your document. You can confirm or adjust as needed."

⬜ Brand Values:
💬 "I found references to Confidence, Self-Expression, and Inclusivity. Do these reflect your brand’s values?"
[Yes, Looks Good] [Edit]

⬜ Brand Voice:
💬 "Your document frequently uses words like ‘Empower’ and ‘Bold.’ I’d categorize your brand voice as ‘Confident, Empowering, and Body-Positive.’ Does that match?"
[Yes, Looks Good] [Edit]

⬜ Tone & Language Style:
💬 "I detected a mix of storytelling and direct messaging. Would you like your AI assistant to prioritize one style?"
[Storytelling] [Direct] [Balanced]

🚀 This is a smarter, more user-friendly approach. Instead of making users input everything manually, AI proactively suggests answers.

4️⃣ If AI Truly Can’t Find Data, THEN It Should Ask for Manual Input
💬 AI: "I couldn’t find clear brand values. Would you like to enter them manually?"
💬 AI: "I couldn’t determine your brand voice. How would you describe it?"

🔹 Why?

Only ask for manual input as a last resort.
Make sure AI tries to infer data first.
5️⃣ Confidence Score & Final Summary
💬 AI: "Your brand profile is now set! Here’s a summary of what I learned:"

🎯 Confidence Score: 85% ✅ (Strong match, minor refinements suggested)
📝 Brand Summary:
✅ Brand Voice: Confident, Empowering, Inclusive
✅ Tone Style: Balanced – mix of storytelling & direct messaging
✅ Key Brand Values: Confidence, Self-Expression, Inclusivity

✅ Call to Action: "Does this look good? You can always edit it later in your Brand Dashboard." [Confirm] [Edit]

🔹 Next Steps: Send This to Replit for Implementation
Subject: Fixing AI Brand Extraction Flow

Hi [Replit Team],

Currently, the AI isn’t making an effort to extract brand values and voice before defaulting to manual input fields. Here’s how to improve the flow:

1️⃣ AI Should First Attempt to Extract & Suggest Data
If values aren’t explicitly labeled, AI should try to infer them based on recurring words/themes.
Example: If the document mentions "confidence, empowerment, and self-expression," AI should suggest Confidence, Empowerment, Self-Expression as brand values.
2️⃣ AI Should Present Suggested Findings for User Confirmation
✅ Instead of showing empty fields, AI should display:

"I found these as possible brand values: Confidence, Self-Expression, Inclusivity. Does this sound right?" [Yes] [Edit]
"Your document uses words like ‘Bold’ and ‘Empower.’ Your brand voice might be Confident, Empowering, and Body-Positive. Does this match?" [Yes] [Edit]
3️⃣ If AI Is Still Uncertain, THEN It Should Ask for Manual Input
AI should only display "I didn’t find clear brand values" if no inferred matches are available.
4️⃣ Confidence Score & Final Summary for Transparency
AI should calculate a confidence score based on the extracted data.
If confidence is low, AI should recommend uploading more materials.
Expected Fixes:
✅ No more empty fields when AI can infer answers.
✅ AI proactively suggests values instead of making users input them manually.
✅ Improved user experience and higher accuracy in brand extraction.

Thanks, looking forward to the update!
