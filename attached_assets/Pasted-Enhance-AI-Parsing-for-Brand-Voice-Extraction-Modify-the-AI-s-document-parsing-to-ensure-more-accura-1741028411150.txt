Enhance AI Parsing for Brand Voice Extraction
Modify the AI’s document parsing to ensure more accurate extraction of brand identity, voice, and tone from uploaded guidelines, websites, and documents.

🔹 1️⃣ Step 1: Improve Section Recognition & Categorization
✅ AI must identify section headers (e.g., "Mission & Vision," "Brand Values," "Brand Voice") and classify them correctly.
✅ If headers are not explicitly labeled, AI should use keyword detection (e.g., “Our mission is,” “We believe,” “Our values are”).

🔹 2️⃣ Step 2: Smart Data Validation & Fallbacks
✅ If AI fails to find mission, values, or brand voice:

Instead of returning “Unknown” or “Not Specified,” AI should ask the user:
"I didn’t find a clear mission statement. Would you like to enter it manually?"
✅ AI should attempt inference based on similar sections within the document.
🔹 3️⃣ Step 3: Deep Semantic Parsing for Brand Voice & Tone
✅ AI should analyze full sentences to extract implied tone, even if not explicitly labeled.
✅ Example:

If the document contains words like “empower,” “confidence,” “self-expression”, AI should infer that the brand voice is empowering, confident, and expressive.
✅ AI should categorize:
Tone of Voice (e.g., Professional, Playful, Bold, Empathetic).
Formality Level (Casual vs. Corporate).
Sentence Style (Short & punchy vs. Long-form storytelling).
🔹 4️⃣ Step 4: Two-Step Extraction Process for Higher Accuracy
✅ Step 1: Structural Parsing – Identify headings, subheadings, and section blocks.
✅ Step 2: Semantic Parsing – Extract meaning from entire paragraphs, not just keywords.
✅ AI should cross-reference extracted insights across sections to ensure consistency.

🔹 5️⃣ Step 5: AI Feedback Loops & User Confirmation
✅ If AI extracts partial or uncertain information, it should ask the user to validate:

"I identified the following as your brand tone: Confident, Empowering, Inclusive. Does this sound right?"
✅ If a user corrects AI, the system should learn and refine future parsing.
🔹 Expected Outcome:
✅ Mission & Values will no longer return "Not Specified" if present in the document.
✅ Brand Voice & Tone will be inferred even if not explicitly labeled.
✅ No blank fields – AI will prompt users for missing details instead of showing "unknown."
✅ More accurate, brand-aligned AI-generated content.
