Optimized User Journey for the Brand Guidelines Feature
Project Vision:
Develop an AI-powered social media management tool that ensures all content aligns with a brand’s unique voice. This feature automatically gathers key brand information during onboarding, then uses an adaptive survey to fine-tune the brand voice. The AI compiles this data into comprehensive brand guidelines that guide content generation, ensuring consistency, high engagement, and a professional, on-brand social presence.

Phase 1: Onboarding & Basic Brand Guidelines Setup (Short-Term Enhancements)
Step 1: Mandatory Onboarding Questions
Purpose: Quickly capture essential brand details to form a strong foundation for AI-generated content.
Questions Include:
Brand Name: (e.g., “Clique Agency”)
Industry/Niche: (e.g., Technology, Fashion, Food)
Target Audience: (demographics, interests)
Preferred Social Platforms: (e.g., Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn)
Core Brand Values: (e.g., innovation, reliability, playfulness)
Competitor Brands/Inspirations: (examples for tone/style)
Emoji Usage Preference: (Yes/No)
Formality Tone Scale: (Casual → Professional → Corporate)
Benefit: Ensures every brand starts with a well-defined baseline that guides the AI’s content generation.

Step 2: Optional Adaptive Deep-Dive Survey
Purpose: For brands wanting extra precision, offer an in-depth, adaptive survey that refines the brand voice.
Features:
Multiple-Choice & Sliding Scale Questions: e.g., “How playful should your tone be?”
Example Captions: Show real-life examples and ask, “Which caption best reflects your brand?”
Visual and Style Preferences: Gather insights on design aesthetics and preferred imagery.
Adaptive Flow: The survey adjusts questions based on previous answers (e.g., if emojis are not favored, skip further emoji-related queries).
Benefit: Provides granular data that the AI uses to auto-generate more precise and optimized brand guidelines.

Step 3: AI-Generated Brand Guidelines Compilation
What It Does:
Synthesizes Onboarding & Survey Responses: Produces a comprehensive document outlining the brand’s voice, tone, and style.
Includes Key Components:
Brand Voice Description: A summary of the brand personality.
Tone & Style Recommendations: Specific do’s and don’ts for writing posts.
Preferred Vocabulary & Emoji Usage: Guidelines on word choice and emoji inclusion.
Hashtag & Keyword Strategy: Suggestions based on industry and audience.
Example On-Brand Posts: Sample posts for quick reference.
User Interaction:
Users can review, edit, and tweak the generated guidelines.
There is an option to regenerate examples if the initial output isn’t satisfactory.
Benefit: Quickly provides a detailed, actionable guide for consistent AI-generated content that matches the client’s brand.

Step 4: Manual Guidelines Upload/Entry (Alternative Path)
Option for Existing Brands:
Users can manually enter or upload a PDF/DOC of their existing brand guidelines.
The AI then parses the document to extract key attributes and integrates them into the platform’s guidelines.
Benefit: Saves time for brands that already have defined voice guidelines while ensuring they’re integrated with the AI’s content-generation process.
Step 5: Continuous Refinement & AI Chat Integration
Ongoing Editing:
Users can revisit and update the guidelines anytime from a dedicated “Brand Voice” settings page.
Performance-Driven Adaptation:
The system monitors post performance and suggests guideline adjustments based on what content drives engagement.
Contextual AI Chat Assistant:
Smart Integration: Instead of a persistent widget, include a small “Assistant” button that opens a side panel when clicked.
Functionality: The AI can answer questions like “Does this caption match my brand?” or “Suggest a more playful version,” using the stored guidelines as reference.
Benefit: This feedback loop ensures the brand voice remains optimized and evolves with the brand’s needs over time.
