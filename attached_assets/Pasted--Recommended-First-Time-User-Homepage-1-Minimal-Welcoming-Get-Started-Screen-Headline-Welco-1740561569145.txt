Recommended First-Time User Homepage
1. Minimal, Welcoming “Get Started” Screen
* Headline: “Welcome to Thinque Agent!” (or your chosen product name)
* Sub-Headline (one sentence): “Your AI-powered social media partner, here to create and manage on-brand content effortlessly.”
* Quick Blurb: A brief, friendly explanation: “Let’s get your brand set up so we can start creating posts and automating your social media.”
Why This Works:
* Gives the user an immediate sense of purpose and sets a warm, approachable tone.
* Apple-like minimalism means you don’t bombard them with text—just a short, polished welcome.

2. Primary Call-to-Action: “Start Setup” or “Let’s Get Started”
* Prominent Button: e.g. “Start Setup” or “Begin Brand Setup”
* Placement: Centered in the main panel, with a clear color contrast (e.g., a bold accent color).
* What It Does:
    * Launches the short, mandatory onboarding wizard (the “brand guidelines” Q&A or chat-based flow).
    * Alternatively, it could open a multi-step “Setup Wizard” that includes:
        1. Brand Guidelines (essential questions)
        2. Social Account Connection (optional at this stage but typically next)
        3. (Optional) Advanced Survey for brand voice refinement
Why This Works:
* A single, well-labeled button keeps the experience clean and intuitive.
* Users know exactly how to proceed—no confusion about what to click first.

3. Secondary Options for Users Who Prefer Manual Exploration
* “I Already Have Guidelines” or “Upload Brand Guidelines”
    * A smaller text link or button near the main CTA.
    * If clicked, leads to the “Brand Guidelines” page, where they can upload or manually input existing guidelines.
* “Skip for Now” or “Explore on My Own”
    * Another small link letting users skip the wizard.
    * If they skip, they land on a simplified dashboard with suggestions or empty states (like “No brand guidelines yet,” “No posts scheduled,” etc.).
Why This Works:
* Respects users who might have existing brand materials or prefer to see the rest of the tool before committing to setup.
* Maintains a minimal interface by tucking these secondary paths into smaller, well-labeled links.

4. (Optional) Quick Glance Dashboard or Next Steps Panel
To give a sense of what the platform offers, you can display a Next Steps panel or minimal “at-a-glance” stats:
1. Brand Guidelines: 0 (or “Not set up yet”)
2. Connected Social Accounts: 0
3. Scheduled Posts: 0
4. Recent Engagement: N/A
Underneath: A short bullet list like:
* 1. [Set Up Your Brand Guidelines] (links to the wizard or brand page)
* 2. [Connect Your Social Accounts]
* 3. [Generate Your First Post]
Why This Works:
* Gives immediate clarity on the user’s “to-do list” and the core functionalities of the app.
* Provides an Apple-like, guided approach with minimal clutter.

5. Subtle AI Chat/Assistant Prompt (If You Have a Chat Model)
* Small Chat Icon in a corner or side panel, labeled “AI Assistant” or “Need Help?”
* On first load, it might do a gentle highlight (e.g., a small pulse) to indicate: “Click here anytime for help or to set up your brand guidelines.”
Why This Works:
* Doesn’t intrude on the user’s immediate tasks.
* Reassures them there’s an AI helper if they get stuck or want to skip the wizard and just ask direct questions.

User Flow Example
1. User Registers & Logs In
    * Sees the minimal “Welcome” screen with a short message, a big “Start Setup” button, and two smaller links: “Upload Guidelines” or “Skip for Now.”
2. Clicks “Start Setup”
    * Launches the brand guidelines Q&A wizard.
    * They fill out the essential tone and audience info.
    * Wizard either ends with “Would you like to connect social accounts now or later?” or simply returns them to the main dashboard upon completion.
3. Returns to Dashboard
    * Now sees partial stats: brand guidelines set to “Complete,” connected social accounts: “0,” etc.
    * Possibly a CTA prompting them to “Generate your first post” or “Connect accounts.”
4. At Any Point
    * If they have a PDF or doc, they can either:
        * Upload it from the wizard prompt (if not completed yet).
        * Go to the Brand Guidelines page and click “Upload Guidelines.”
    * The AI merges or updates the guidelines, user sees changes in real time.

Why This is Effective
1. Immediate Clarity
    * The user sees exactly where to start—no confusion or extraneous steps.
2. Focused Onboarding
    * The wizard approach ensures new users provide enough data for the AI to be helpful right away, while the “Skip” link accommodates power users or those exploring.
3. Apple-Like Minimalism
    * A single main CTA, a short welcome blurb, and minimal links create a calm, friendly environment.
    * Clear typography, spacing, and microcopy keep it professional.
4. Encourages Setup Completion
    * By showing “0 brand guidelines” or “No posts yet” in the dash, it subtly nudges users to finalize setup.
5. Flexible Upload
    * Users can integrate existing guidelines whenever they want—no forced path.
    * The system is adaptive, letting them see the AI’s benefits immediately or skip around as needed.
