When parsing through a brand's website, guidelines, and documents:
1. Brand Identity & Core Messaging
Brand mission statement: What is the company’s purpose and vision?
Brand values: Core principles that define the company (e.g., sustainability, innovation, luxury, humor, inclusivity).
Taglines and slogans: Signature phrases that define the brand’s unique positioning.
About Us/Company Story: The way the company describes itself and its origins.
2. Brand Voice & Personality
Tone of Voice: Is it professional, casual, playful, authoritative, empathetic, bold, etc.?
Formality Level: Does the brand use casual/slang terms, or is it formal and corporate?
Use of Humor: Does the brand use jokes, sarcasm, or wordplay?
Directness vs. Storytelling: Does the brand use short, punchy messaging or long-form storytelling?
Sentence Structure: Are sentences concise and to the point, or more elaborate and expressive?
3. Linguistic Patterns & Word Choice
Preferred words & phrases: Does the brand use specific industry jargon or branded terms?
Avoided words: Words that go against the brand identity (e.g., “cheap” for a luxury brand).
Use of contractions: Does the brand favor “you’re” over “you are” for a friendly tone?
Inclusive language: Does the brand use gender-neutral or inclusive language?
4. Visual & Formatting Elements (If Extracted from Brand Docs)
Typography preferences: Does the brand favor uppercase, lowercase, or sentence case for branding?
Punctuation style: Use of exclamation points, emojis, ellipses, or dashes.
Hashtags & Keywords: What common hashtags does the brand use in social posts?
5. Content Style Across Different Channels
Website Copy: How does the brand describe its products/services?
Social Media Posts: What type of engagement tone does it use? Conversational, promotional, informative?
Email & Newsletters: Are emails structured formally or in a personal, friendly way?
Ad Copy: Are ads bold and direct, or more subtle and sophisticated?
6. Customer Engagement & Response Style
Social Media Replies: How does the brand respond to comments? (Friendly, professional, humorous, personal?)
Customer Service Communication: Is it apologetic, solution-driven, or informal?
CTAs (Call to Actions): What verbs and phrasing are used in CTAs? (e.g., “Sign up now!” vs. “Learn more”)
7. Competitor & Industry Benchmarking (Optional but Helpful)
How does this brand’s tone compare to competitors?
Are there key differentiators that make their voice unique in their space?
Next Steps:
Should the AI automatically generate a draft brand tone summary based on this data, or should human users refine the results?
Should there be an interactive questionnaire to fine-tune the understanding of tone preferences based on brand input?
Should the agent provide a confidence score on how well it understands a brand’s voice based on available content?
Let me know if you’d like any of these areas expanded or tailored to your specific needs!
