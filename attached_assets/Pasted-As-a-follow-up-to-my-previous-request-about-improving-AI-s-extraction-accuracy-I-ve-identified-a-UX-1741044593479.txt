As a follow-up to my previous request about improving AI’s extraction accuracy, I’ve identified a UX issue that needs to be fixed.

Currently, the AI overwhelms users by displaying all missing fields at once instead of guiding them through a logical step-by-step process. This creates a poor user experience, especially when AI fails to extract key brand details.

🔹 Summary of Fixes Needed (Quick Reference Table)
Issue	Current Behavior	Optimized Fix
Data Extraction Flow	AI jumps straight to missing values & blank fields	AI should first show what it found before asking for more input
Handling Unclear Data	AI doesn’t attempt to suggest values	AI should suggest inferred values based on document patterns
User Input Process	AI dumps all missing info at once	AI should ask one question at a time
Confidence Score Display	AI shows a 0% score before refinement	Score should only appear after AI makes a real effort
🔹 Detailed Breakdown of Fixes
1️⃣ AI Should Show What It Found First
💬 AI: "Here’s what I found in your document:"
✅ Brand Mission: [Extracted Text]
✅ Brand Values: [Extracted Text] (If AI is unsure, it suggests options)
✅ Brand Voice: [Extracted Text]

✅ Implementation Note for Devs: Before showing any "missing data" prompts, AI must first display the extracted data in a structured way. If AI is unsure, it should suggest likely matches instead of defaulting to blank fields.

2️⃣ If AI is Uncertain, It Should Ask for Clarification One Question at a Time
💬 AI: "Some details weren’t explicitly labeled. Here’s what I inferred based on your document. You can confirm or adjust as needed."

⬜ Brand Values (Only If Unclear):
💬 "I found references to Confidence, Self-Expression, and Inclusivity. Do these reflect your brand’s values?"
[Yes, Looks Good] [Edit]

⬜ Brand Voice (Only If Unclear):
💬 "Your document frequently uses words like ‘Bold’ and ‘Empower.’ I’d categorize your brand voice as ‘Confident, Empowering, and Body-Positive.’ Does that match?"
[Yes, Looks Good] [Edit]

✅ Implementation Note for Devs: AI should only show one refinement prompt at a time. Once the user confirms or edits one section, then the next refinement prompt should appear.

3️⃣ If AI is Completely Uncertain, THEN It Should Ask for Manual Input
💬 AI: "I wasn’t able to detect clear brand values. Would you like to enter them manually or take a brand exercise to refine them?"
[Enter Values] [Take Brand Exercise]

💬 AI: "I couldn’t determine your brand voice. Would you describe it as professional, playful, bold, or something else?"
[Describe Voice] [Skip for Now]

✅ Implementation Note for Devs: If AI still cannot infer brand values or voice, it should guide users with leading questions instead of presenting a blank field.
