Recommended Integration of Document Upload During Brand Guidelines Onboarding
Context & Goal
We want to give users a seamless way to provide existing brand materials (like PDFs or sample content) while they’re setting up their Brand Guidelines in our AI-powered social media management platform. At the same time, we also need a permanent option for future uploads or revisions.

1. Onboarding Wizard: “Do You Have Existing Guidelines?”
Where It Fits
During the brand guidelines onboarding (the Q&A or chat-based flow where users define brand tone, audience, etc.).
How It Works
Wizard Prompt:
After asking the essential brand questions (tone scale, brand values, etc.), the system asks:
“Do you have existing brand guidelines or sample brand content you’d like to upload?”
If User Selects “Yes”:
Present a file-upload interface (e.g., “Upload your PDF, DOC, or image files”).
AI Parsing: Once uploaded, the system immediately extracts relevant data (e.g., brand voice descriptors, key phrases) and merges it with the user’s typed answers.
If User Selects “No” or “Skip”:
They simply continue through the wizard.
They’ll still be able to upload documents later on the Brand Guidelines page (see below).
Benefit:

Allows users who already have formal brand guidelines to incorporate them right away without forcing them to re-enter everything.
Ensures the AI’s initial brand guidelines output is as robust as possible.
2. Brand Guidelines Page: “Upload Guidelines” Button
Where It Fits
Inside the dedicated Brand Guidelines section (which might show the AI-generated guidelines or be empty if not set up yet).
How It Works
Upload Button:
Display a clear “Upload Guidelines” or “Upload Documents” button at the top (or near “Create Guidelines”).
Document Parsing & Merge:
If the user uploads a new file, the system again extracts brand voice data and updates the existing guidelines.
If the user had no guidelines before, this step effectively “creates” them.
Versioning / Confirmation (Optional):
Show a diff or a summary of new findings, and let the user confirm or tweak any newly added brand voice attributes.
Benefit:

Users can come back anytime (weeks or months later) if they discover a new brand doc or update their style guide.
Maintains a single, permanent home for brand voice info, ensuring ongoing refinement.
3. Why This Hybrid Approach Is Best
Seamless Onboarding Experience

No extra steps for users who have docs ready during initial setup—they can integrate them immediately.
No confusion for users who skip; they can keep going and still see an upload option later.
Intuitive “One-Stop” Brand Guidelines Page

The Upload feature is always there for updates.
Ensures brand guidelines remain a living document that can adapt over time.
Maximizes AI Utility

The AI can parse brand docs early for a more accurate first pass.
Users can refine or expand guidelines later without re-running the entire wizard.
Implementation Tips
Wizard Flow:

Keep the question about existing docs near the end of the brand Q&A, so the user has a chance to fill in basic info first.
Use a “Yes/No” or “Skip” approach to keep it simple.
Document Parsing:

Summarize key extracted points for the user to confirm or edit before finalizing.
Possibly highlight any new brand rules or disclaimers the AI found.
User Interface:

Show a success message: “We’ve updated your Brand Guidelines based on your upload!”
If conflicts arise between user’s typed answers and the doc, either prompt for resolution or default to user input.
Ongoing Refinement:

Encourage the user to revisit the Brand Guidelines page if they want to merge new doc data or adjust tone after testing content performance.
Conclusion
By offering the document upload option in both the onboarding wizard and the Brand Guidelines page, you deliver a flexible yet straightforward user journey:

New Clients can integrate existing brand docs right away for more accurate AI-generated guidelines.
Returning or Evolving Brands can upload new or revised docs at any time, ensuring the brand voice remains updated and consistent.
This hybrid approach aligns with a user-friendly, Apple-like interface philosophy—intuitive, minimal friction, and ready to adapt whenever the brand’s voice or assets change.
