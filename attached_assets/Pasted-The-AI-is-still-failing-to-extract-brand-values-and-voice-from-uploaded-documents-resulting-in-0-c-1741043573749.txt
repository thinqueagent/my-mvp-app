The AI is still failing to extract brand values and voice from uploaded documents, resulting in 0% confidence scores.

1️⃣ Core Issues with Current AI Behavior
❌ AI is not making an effort to extract or infer brand values or voice before defaulting to blank fields.
❌ AI is not recognizing mission statements, values, or brand voice indicators even when they are present in the document.
❌ The Confidence Score system is not functioning correctly → If AI can’t detect anything, it should still assign a partial score based on what it did recognize.

2️⃣ Required Fixes
✅ AI Must Extract & Suggest Before Defaulting to “Unknown”

Instead of leaving fields blank, AI should suggest possible matches:
Example:
"I found references to Confidence, Self-Expression, and Inclusivity. Do these reflect your brand’s values?" [Yes] [Edit]
"Your document frequently uses words like ‘Empower’ and ‘Bold.’ Your brand voice might be Confident, Empowering, and Body-Positive. Does this match?" [Yes] [Edit]
✅ Fix Confidence Score Calculation

AI should never return 0% unless the document is completely empty.
If only partial data is found, it should assign a mid-range score (40-70%) and suggest refinements.
If AI is uncertain, it should prompt:
"Your confidence score is 75%. Want to refine this further?"

✅ Improve AI’s Text Parsing & Keyword Recognition

AI should not just rely on section headers but analyze full paragraphs.
Fix: AI should recognize mission-related phrases even if the document doesn’t explicitly use "Mission" or "Brand Values" as headings.
Example: If the document says "We believe every woman should feel confident in their swimsuit," AI should infer → Brand Value: Confidence & Body Positivity.
3️⃣ Expected Fixes
✔ AI proactively suggests extracted brand values/voice instead of making users manually enter everything.
✔ Confidence Score accurately reflects partial extractions instead of defaulting to 0%.
✔ AI improves keyword recognition to detect mission, values, and voice even when phrased differently.

Let me know when these updates are applied so I can test again.
