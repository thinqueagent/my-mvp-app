As a follow-up to my previous request about improving AI’s extraction accuracy, there’s also a UX issue in how the AI presents missing information to users. Right now, it overwhelms users by showing all missing fields at once instead of guiding them step-by-step.

🔹 Fix: AI Should Guide Users Step-by-Step Instead of Dumping Everything at Once
1️⃣ AI Should Show What It Found First
💬 AI: "Here’s what I found in your document:"
✅ Brand Mission: [Extracted Text]
✅ Brand Values: [Extracted Text] (If AI is unsure, it suggests options)
✅ Brand Voice: [Extracted Text]

This ensures users see what AI extracted before being asked for input.

2️⃣ If AI is Uncertain, It Should Ask for Clarification One Question at a Time
💬 AI: "Some details weren’t explicitly labeled. Here’s what I inferred based on your document. You can confirm or adjust as needed."

⬜ Brand Values (Only If Unclear):
💬 "I found references to Confidence, Self-Expression, and Inclusivity. Do these reflect your brand’s values?"
[Yes, Looks Good] [Edit]

⬜ Brand Voice (Only If Unclear):
💬 "Your document frequently uses words like ‘Bold’ and ‘Empower.’ I’d categorize your brand voice as ‘Confident, Empowering, and Body-Positive.’ Does that match?"
[Yes, Looks Good] [Edit]

🚀 Why?

AI should guide users step-by-step instead of overwhelming them.
Feels more conversational and user-friendly.
3️⃣ If AI is Completely Uncertain, THEN It Should Ask for Manual Input
💬 AI: "I wasn’t able to detect clear brand values. Would you like to enter them manually or take a brand exercise to refine them?"
[Enter Values] [Take Brand Exercise]

💬 AI: "I couldn’t determine your brand voice. Would you describe it as professional, playful, bold, or something else?"
[Describe Voice] [Skip for Now]

🚀 Why?
✔ Only asks users for input when necessary.
✔ Guides users toward an answer instead of forcing manual entry.

4️⃣ Confidence Score Should Appear After Refinements, Not Before
💬 AI: "Your brand profile is now set! Here’s a summary of what I learned:"

🎯 Confidence Score: 85% ✅ (Strong match, minor refinements suggested)
📝 Brand Summary:
✅ Brand Voice: Confident, Empowering, Inclusive
✅ Tone Style: Balanced – mix of storytelling & direct messaging
✅ Key Brand Values: Confidence, Self-Expression, Inclusivity

💬 AI: "Want to refine this further?"
[Upload More Data] [Take Brand Exercise] [Continue]

🚀 Why?
✔ Confidence Score should only appear after AI has made a real effort.
✔ Users should be able to refine further instead of being stuck with a low score.
