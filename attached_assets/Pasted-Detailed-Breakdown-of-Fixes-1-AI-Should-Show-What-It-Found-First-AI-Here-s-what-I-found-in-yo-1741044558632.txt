Detailed Breakdown of Fixes
1️⃣ AI Should Show What It Found First
💬 AI: "Here’s what I found in your document:"
✅ Brand Mission: [Extracted Text]
✅ Brand Values: [Extracted Text] (If AI is unsure, it suggests options)
✅ Brand Voice: [Extracted Text]

✅ Implementation Note for Devs: Before showing any "missing data" prompts, AI must first display the extracted data in a structured way. If AI is unsure, it should suggest likely matches instead of defaulting to blank fields.

2️⃣ If AI is Uncertain, It Should Ask for Clarification One Question at a Time
💬 AI: "Some details weren’t explicitly labeled. Here’s what I inferred based on your document. You can confirm or adjust as needed."

⬜ Brand Values (Only If Unclear):
💬 "I found references to Confidence, Self-Expression, and Inclusivity. Do these reflect your brand’s values?"
[Yes, Looks Good] [Edit]

⬜ Brand Voice (Only If Unclear):
💬 "Your document frequently uses words like ‘Bold’ and ‘Empower.’ I’d categorize your brand voice as ‘Confident, Empowering, and Body-Positive.’ Does that match?"
[Yes, Looks Good] [Edit]

✅ Implementation Note for Devs: AI should only show one refinement prompt at a time. Once the user confirms or edits one section, then the next refinement prompt should appear.

3️⃣ If AI is Completely Uncertain, THEN It Should Ask for Manual Input
💬 AI: "I wasn’t able to detect clear brand values. Would you like to enter them manually or take a brand exercise to refine them?"
[Enter Values] [Take Brand Exercise]

💬 AI: "I couldn’t determine your brand voice. Would you describe it as professional, playful, bold, or something else?"
[Describe Voice] [Skip for Now]

✅ Implementation Note for Devs: If AI still cannot infer brand values or voice, it should guide users with leading questions instead of presenting a blank field.

4️⃣ Confidence Score Should Appear After Refinements, Not Before
💬 AI: "Your brand profile is now set! Here’s a summary of what I learned:"

🎯 Confidence Score: 85% ✅ (Strong match, minor refinements suggested)
📝 Brand Summary:
✅ Brand Voice: Confident, Empowering, Inclusive
✅ Tone Style: Balanced – mix of storytelling & direct messaging
✅ Key Brand Values: Confidence, Self-Expression, Inclusivity

💬 AI: "Want to refine this further?"
[Upload More Data] [Take Brand Exercise] [Continue]

✅ Implementation Note for Devs: AI should not display the confidence score before refinement options. Users should see suggestions and refinement options first, and only then get a confidence score.
